## Game Overview 
![](Assets/thumb.png)
A journey to explore peopleâ€™s influence on society. During the journey, we will face different puzzles. They can draw or cut the friendship among people to spread the things around the whole world. Our user could choose to register an account or just skip. There are three puzzles for them to solve and one sandbox for them to self-design the puzzle.  
### Inspiration
_The game is inspired by a Website called "[The Wisdom and/or Madness of Crowds](https://ncase.me/crowds/)"_
